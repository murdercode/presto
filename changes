feat:

- Added localization using paraglide.js, languages are English and Italian (AI translation).
- Added language switcher in settings with relevant CSS file (definitely needs to be adjusted).

explanation:

- Static content is translated on page load.
- Dynamic content is handled by the companion DynamicTextUpdater.
- User preferences are persisted across sessions.

- Messages are saved in {locale}.json and accessed using m['parent.child']() function.
- There is a localization manager (utils/localization.js) which ultimately handles the following:

  - Locale switching
  - Text updates during runtime (after switching language)
  - Updates the HTML `lang` tag

- There is also a dynamic text updater (utils/dynamic-text-updater.js) that updates text content when:

  - Timer state changes
  - DOM elements are added dynamically
